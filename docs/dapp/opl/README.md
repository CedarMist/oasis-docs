# Oasis Privacy Layer

The Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) is an EVM-compatible privacy solution that allows
you to extend your existing contracts running on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and
Polygon with secret transactions and state.

## DApp Development

The Oasis Privacy Layer contains a set of [smart contracts](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/tree/main/contracts/contracts/opl)
that integrate [Sapphire](../sapphire/README.mdx) into your existing and future
Web3 applications and introduce confidentiality.

Application developers on any EVM-compatible network can add confidential state
and selective disclosures to their applications through the usage of a smart
contract deployed on OPL without leaving their existing networks.

For more information about OPL and to catch the latest news, please visit the
official [page](https://oasisprotocol.org/opl).
