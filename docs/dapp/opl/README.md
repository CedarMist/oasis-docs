# Oasis Privacy Layer

The Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) is an EVM-compatible privacy solution that
empowers developers to add new functionality to smart contracts on the most
popular EVM networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon with encrypted
transactions and confidential state.

## DApp Development

The Oasis Privacy Layer contains a set of [smart contracts](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/sapphire-paratime/tree/main/contracts/contracts/opl)
that integrate [Sapphire](../sapphire/README.mdx) into your existing and future
Web3 applications, introducing confidentiality.

Application developers on any EVM-compatible network can add confidential state
and selective disclosures to their application through the usage of a smart
contract deployed on OPL without migrating their application stack. OPL enabled
smart contracts provide a default bridge for developers to pass messages
between Sapphire and other networks.
